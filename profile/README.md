## The Problem Today

- **Fragmentation**: Every OEM has its own platform, language, and lock-in.  
- **Error-prone workflows**: Manual coding & testing cause costly downtime.  
- **High barriers**: Full automation is only accessible to corporations with high budgets.  

Manufacturers are stuck with outdated processes while hardware is commoditizing. Integration, not hardware, is now the **true bottleneck**.

## 💡 Our Approach

Xelerit ADE is a **unified, AI-driven platform** that transforms integration into an automated process:  

- 🔗 **Hardware-agnostic integration** — connect heterogeneous robots & controllers without vendor lock-in.  
- 🤖 **Agentic programming** — intelligent agents generate, optimize, and validate control code.  
- 🧪 **Simulation-first validation** — test and optimize workflows virtually before deployment.  
- ⚡ **Scalable by design** — modular building blocks for factories of any size.

## 🔬 Technology Pillars

- **LLMs + AI Agents**: Convert high-level intent into executable code across multiple PLCs, robots, and controllers.  
- **Simulation Environments**: Automate testing of thousands of scenarios to minimize downtime.  
- **Optimization Engines**: Reduce cycle times, energy waste, and wear on hardware.  
- **API-first Design**: Xelerit ADE integrates seamlessly with existing workflows and toolchains.
